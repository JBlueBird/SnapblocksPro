# 🧠 SnapBlocks Editor Pro

hiya!! welcome to **SnapBlocks Editor Pro** — it’s like Scratch, but you TYPE the code instead of dragging it around. and then it magically turns into blocks 😎💥

this is the PRO edition. it’s got a live block preview, a bunch of blocks you can drag in, and you can save + load your code too. just don’t ask it to export as PNG or SVG anymore. i removed those. bye-bye. 🫡

## 🛠 what can it do???

- ✍️ **type your code** like:
  ```
  when flag clicked
  move (10) steps
  say [hello] for (2) seconds
  ```
- 🧱 **drag blocks** from the sidebar and drop them right in the editor
- 🔁 **reset to the default code** if you mess everything up (like i always do)
- 💾 **save your masterpiece** as a `.txt` file (yes txt! we’re old school)
- 📂 **load your code back in** whenever you want (even years later… probably)
- ✨ **see the blocks** appear live as you type — they animate too. fancy right?

---

## 🧪 how do i use it??

1. open the `index.html` file in your browser
2. type code in the editor on the left
3. look at your epic Snap-style blocks show up on the right
4. press buttons on the top toolbar if you feel like it

## 📌 just so you know

- this is **not** Scratch
- but it feels like it
- it’s powered by [snapblocks.js](https://github.com/tjvr/snapblocks) (thanks to tjvr, u r cool)
- you can write Scratch-style text and it turns into blocks!
- code saves as `.txt`, not some weird file format (yay!)

---

## 🧠 future ideas maybe??

- add more blocks like control, sound, variables, 🧂 etc
- maybe bring back svg export if people riot
- make themes like “neon hacker green” or “my eyes hurt pink”
- add search for blocks if you're lazy (like me)

## 🐣 fun fact

the first version of this had png export  
... then i realized it had lots of bugs
so now it’s gone

## ok bye now
